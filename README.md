# LegoOtter
 Final project for the Computer Graphics class at the ITESM with professor, Sergio Ruiz.
 Consists on a simple lego construction in the form of an otter.
 The original lego model was taken from: https://frugalfun4boys.com/ocean-lego-projects-to-build-sea-turtle-crab-otter-and-fish/
 
Our work consisted on modeling only the necessary 3D objects for the lego pieces, such as only a single piece and then instantiating the rest through code in unity, forming the more complex pieces.

 Every piece, whether simple or complex, should be instantiated inside the code and nothing shold be visible in the scene before it starts (Except for UI). The objetct must had at least 2 moving sections (simple animation), in this case, the head and the tail and a simple particle system that can represent an action.
 
 
 Every static piece could only be assigned a position inside the scene through matrix operations (translations and rotations), so it formed the object, but, those pieces that can move should be positioned and aligned so they move like one object
